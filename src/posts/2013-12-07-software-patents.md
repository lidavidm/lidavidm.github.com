excerpt: <p>A non-technical look on what software patents mean for you</p>
---

Say you’re an aspiring writer. You’ve toiled endless hours working on your
book, telling the tale of a lieutenant and his betrayal of his general,
picking each word carefully, giving your sentences that twist, perfectly
capturing the image of the spring vista outside your window, the backdrop of
your epic. You publish your book and immediately make it onto the *New York
Times* bestseller list. Time to sit back and relax…

One day, you open your mail and see a legal notice[^1]. Another writer,
someone named William Shakespeare, says he has a patent on stories
[about lieutenants who betray their masters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello).
*That’s ridiculous*, you say. *Plots are ideas and that Shakespeare can’t
patent them!*[^2]

What are your options?

Well, you remember reading a
[story similar to Shakespeare’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello#Cinthio_source),
published long before the Bard received his patent. Perhaps you could
challenge him in court and invalidate the patent? How much would that cost?

__$500,000__—in legal fees[^3]. That’s not counting the settlement you’d have
to pay if you lose.

Pick yourself up off that floor. There’s more to that legal notice.

*But*, you whine, *how am I supposed to know?*

Good question. Here’s another one: what’s the difference between a patent on
“a means of communicating a story in which an official betrays his superior”
and a patent on “a method of communicating a tale about the betrayal of a
general by a subordinate”? How are you supposed to search for patents that
could cover your story, given that you could word and reword and reword the
same idea multiple ways? Or that you could have multiple slightly different
ideas that still cover your story?

And let’s consider what Shakespeare could demand from you. He could ask that
you __license__ his patent—in effect, that you pay him money to use his
“invention”. He could ask for an __injunction__—that you censor your book
and not publish or sell it. Or you could refuse, and __rewrite__ your book
to avoid his patent.

*This is still ridiculous. You can’t actually patent stories!* And indeed
you can’t. But this is just an allegory—now consider this real-life example.

Now, you are
[Fred Chang](http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=25730570),
CEO of [Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com), a successful online electronics
retailer. And how do people buy from your store? They put products in a
shopping cart, of course. Just like every other site, just like they do in
the physical world.

And one day you (i.e., some drone in your legal office) receive a legal
notice from Soverain Software. They
[claim to own the idea of a shopping cart](https://www.google.com/patents/US5715314). Of
course, they refer to it as a “network sales system”, and want their
*rightful* share of your profits.
[Amazon has already agreed to pay $40 million](http://www.zdnet.com/news/amazon-pays-40-million-to-settle-patent-dispute/144171). Soverain
wants $34 million from you. Every other company targeted has
[agreed to settle](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/how-newegg-crushed-the-shopping-cart-patent-and-saved-online-retail/). What
would you do in Newegg’s shoes?

In the case of Newegg, they decided to fight. Newegg lost the first
trial. Indeed, the judge didn’t even let the jury hear their argument that
the patent was invalid! Luckily, upon appeal, the judgement was overruled
and the patent declared invalid. A good ending for Newegg, and an example of
justice: a predatory company that makes no products, a *patent troll*, has
its patent invalidated.

But in the real world, not every story has a happy ending. And not every
aggressor is an obvious troll. Let’s look at Samsung vs Apple, the two
titans on the sides of the Android phone vs iPhone battle.

In 2011, Apple filed suit against Samsung, claiming that Samsung’s products
infringed upon Apple patents for such features as double-tap-to-zoom and
pinch-to-zoom, seeking __$2.75 billion__ in damages[^4]. Apple was
originally awarded $1.05 billion, still a staggering sum, and of course
Samsung has appealed, the award has been changed, etc. As of this writing,
the
[retrial is still dragging on](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57613382-37/jury-reaches-verdict-in-apple-v-samsung-damages-retrial/). Samsung
could easily see its products banned from the US market, leaving consumers
with less competition in the smartphone market. And what products remain
could face price increases, as manufacturers must then license Apple’s
patents or face litigation. In fact,
[HTC has already agreed to license from Apple](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/11/11HTC-and-Apple-Settle-Patent-Dispute.html),
under unknown but likely onerous terms.

What is the purpose of patents? To protect inventions from copycats. Is an
online shopping cart an invention? (Yes, said Soverain.)  Is
[slide-to-unlock](http://9gag.com/gag/219293) (warning: Internet meme) an
invention? (Yes, says Apple.) Is a little tray that holds all your
notifications an invention? (Yes, says Google.)

But are these *inventions*? Or are they *ideas*?

This is the world of software
patents. [Lawsuits are only increasing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/29/new-zealand-just-abolished-software-patents-heres-why-we-should-too/),
the number of software patents is steadily climbing, and the damages are now
in the billions. Is there a solution? Any number of academics, policymakers,
and others have proposed reforms, laws, bans. But ultimately, it remains up
to us—the consumers—to make this problem a priority, not just an abstruse
debate.
