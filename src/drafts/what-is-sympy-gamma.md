[SymPy](http://www.sympy.org) is a symbolic algebra library/computer algebra
system (CAS) written in pure Python. The *symbolic* part of SymPy means that
it can manipulate mathematical expressions, not just numbers—ask it to do an
integral and it’ll return an antiderivative. Beyond the Python library,
SymPy also maintains two web applications:
[SymPy Live](http://live.sympy.org) and
[SymPy Gamma](http://www.sympygamma.com). Let’s take a look at some of
Gamma’s features.

First off, what is Gamma? Basically, it’s a “clone” of Wolfram|Alpha. Rather
than trying to maintain direct feature parity, however, Gamma’s goal is to
serve as an advanced calculator of sorts and demonstrate what SymPy is
capable of at the same time.
