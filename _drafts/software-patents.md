excerpt: <p>A non-technical look on what software patents mean for you</p>

Say you’re an aspiring writer. You’ve toiled endless hours working on your
book telling the tale of a lieutenant and his betrayal of his general,
picking each word carefully, giving your sentences that twist, perfectly
capturing the image of the spring vista outside your window. You publish
your book and immediately make it onto the *New York Times* bestseller
list. Time to sit back and relax…

Then you open your mail one day and see a legal notice[^1]. Another writer,
someone named William Shakespeare, says he has a patent on stories
[about lieutenants who betray their masters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello).
*That’s ridiculous*, you say. *Plots are ideas and that Shakespeare can’t
patent them! [^2]*

What are your options?

Well, you remember reading a
[story similar to Shakespeare’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello#Cinthio_source),
published long before the Bard received his patent. Perhaps you could
challenge him in court and invalidate the patent? How much would that cost?

$500,000. In legal fees[^3]. That’s not counting the settlement you’d have
to pay if you lose.

Pick yourself up off that floor. There’s more to that legal notice.

*But*, you whine, *how am I supposed to know?*

Good question. Here’s another one: what’s the difference between a patent
on—let’s get the fancy pseudo-legal wording out here—“a means of
communicating a story in which an official betrays his superior” and a
patent on “a method of communicating a story about the betrayal of a general
by a subordinate”? If both of those cover your story
