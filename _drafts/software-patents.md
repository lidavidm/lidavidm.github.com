excerpt: <p>A non-technical look on what software patents mean for you</p>
---

Say you’re an aspiring writer[^1]. You’ve toiled endless hours working on
your book, picking each word carefully, giving your sentences that twist,
perfectly capturing the spring vista outside your window. You publish your
book and immediately make it onto the *New York Times* bestseller list.

But there’s that other writer, William Shakespeare. And he has a bone to
pick with you. While you haven’t *plagarized* him per se, he noticed your
clever sentence structure – and he has a patent on it. Shakespeare demands
you pay up.

You haven’t copied his work – the Bard has not yet published a single word!
– but you have no choice.

And it gets worse, like everything else in life. Another person, somewhat
short of stature, bent over a bit, approaches you, bearing *another* dreaded
patent. The title: “A means of communication using subjects followed by
conjugated verbs”.

Stop. __Stop__. This is *ridiculous*, right? Just some academic nightmare
that has no real-world bearing.

Well, you’re __wrong__.

      by the way.
