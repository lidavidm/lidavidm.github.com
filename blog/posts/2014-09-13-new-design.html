<p>I’ve updated the design of this blog, switching from <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> in the process.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-design">The New Design</h2>
<p>This design is inspired by Google’s new <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a>, and in particular the <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/components/paper-elements/demo.html#core-toolbar">Paper Elements</a> demo. However, it’s not as elaborate as Google’s demos, nor is it animated—I’ve simply taken the superficial look.</p>
<p>Personally I find that Material Design has too much whitespace—Google’s designers know better than I do, but the neon colors and excessive padding bothered me in general. I have also opted for <a href="http://aldusleaf.org/0-crimson.html">Crimson</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a> over Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/typography.html">Roboto</a> font. Admittedly, the <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/meaningful-transitions.html">animations in Material Design are gorgeous</a>—the ink ripple effect is a nice touch, and the way the pages smoothly morph into each other makes the UI feel responsive. I have not replicated them because they’re overkill for this simple blog, but using <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a> to develop a web app with these styles is definitely something I will be trying.</p>
<p>I find the use of shadows, paper, and other skeuomorphic effects in Material Design interesting as well—the current trend has been towards completely flat interfaces, which started with Microsoft’s Zune and continued with Windows Phone 7, Metro, Google’s Holo, and Apple’s iOS 6.</p>
<p>My redesign here is still ongoing—I’d like to differentiate myself from Material Design further</p>
<h2 id="why-hakyll">Why Hakyll</h2>
<p>Github Pages has Jekyll built in, making it quite convenient to use. However, depending on Github to run Jekyll on my repository was frustrating; it took a while for the site to be rebuilt, and I had to wait until then for error messages. There also isn’t a way to disable processing for certain pages—everything gets run through Jekyll, whether I like it or not. Running Jekyll locally would have solved these issues, of course.</p>
