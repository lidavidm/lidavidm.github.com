## What is a software patent?

A <dfn>patent</dfn>[^1] grants an inventor the exclusive rights to her
invention for a limited time in return for publicly disclosing the invention
by applying for a patent. So a <dfn>software patent</dfn> is a patent on a
software invention.

## Why should I care?

Thatâ€™s a great question! See
[my post on software patents](/2013/10/03/software-patents.html) for an
explanation, or look at the list below for a selection of articles about the
problems with software patents.
