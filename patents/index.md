## What is a software patent?

A <dfn>patent</dfn>[^1] grants an inventor the exclusive rights to her
invention for a limited time in return for publicly disclosing the invention
by applying for a patent. So a <dfn>software patent</dfn> is a patent on a
software invention.

## Why should I care?

Here’s an example: back when Blackberries were still popular, a company that
made no products nearly shut down email service for all Blackberry users by
claiming they had patented wireless email.
[RIM ended up paying $600 million](http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/03/technology/rimm_ntp/)
for the invention of sending email over a wireless network instead of a
wire—a patent later rejected as invalid.

Now, Apple has patented
[slide-to-unlock](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=8,046,721.PN.&OS=PN/8,046,721&RS=PN/8,046,721),
the idea of
[searching multiple data sources at once](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN/8086604),
and built-in spell check, while
[suing Samsung](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-sues-samsumg-for-slide-to-unlock-2012-2).
(There's even
[some prior art](http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/699/prior-art-for-apples-unified-search-patent)
for the search patent—evidence that the “invention” isn’t new.) On the other
side of the smartphone wars, Google patented
[the notification shade/center](http://www.google.com/patents/US20090249247). No
lawsuit yet, however—but imagine if Apple had to remove its notification
center from your iPhone. (No worries, though,
[Apple applied for its own patent](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2012170446A3)!)

And beyond the battles of corporate titans, software patents affect us, the
consumers, directly.
[HTC faced a ban on its products](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57345291-37/apple-wins-patent-victory-over-htc-which-faces-looming-import-ban/)
for a feature that recognized phone numbers and addresses in phones. And
[there are more examples]({% post_url 2013-12-07-software-patents %}) in the
smartphone space, in online shopping, and beyond.

Software represents ideas: if you have an idea, you write the algorithm to
make the computer carry that idea out. Thus, patenting software means trying
to patent that algorithm, that idea. Now, is an idea an *invention*?
Historically, no: the U.S. Patent Office gives “abstract ideas” as an
example of what does not qualify for a patent[^2]. Then the natural question
is, does an *implementation* of an idea count as an invention?

Now the waters become murky. For physical inventions, the answer is
obvious—your device carries out the idea and is therefore new. But in
software, the difference is not so clear; every piece of software builds on
others’ algorithms, libraries, and ideas, and two people working
independently can often come upon similar or even identical implementations,
as a
[judge who taught himself programming to prepare for a trial](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57445082-94/judge-william-alsup-master-of-the-court-and-java/)
found. The Supreme Court has struggled with this difference before—and in
*In re Bilski*, ruled that yes, an abstract algorithm implemented on a
physical computer qualifies for a patent, if “(1) it is tied to a particular
machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a
different state or thing”, leaving what qualified as a “transformation”
undefined[^3], never mind the habit of lawyers to twist wording to suit
their purposes.

In the end, software patents exist—and they cause headaches for businesses
who would rather focus on their next product and for consumers who have
features taken away from them because someone else thought of that idea and
patented it. Thus, software patents hinder innovation and reduce
competition—why try to invent new features, working around a minefield of
software patents, when you can sue others instead?—and need reform, which
will only come with awareness.
