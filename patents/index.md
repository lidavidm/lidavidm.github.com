## What is a software patent?

A <dfn>patent</dfn>[^1] grants an inventor the exclusive rights to her
invention for a limited time in return for publicly disclosing the invention
by applying for a patent. So a <dfn>software patent</dfn> is a patent on a
software invention.

## Why should I care?

That’s a great question! See
[my post on software patents]({% post_url 2013-12-07-software-patents %})
for an explanation, or look at the list
below for a selection of articles about the problems with software patents.

Software represents ideas: if you have an idea, you write the algorithm to
make the computer carry that idea out. Thus, patenting software means trying
to patent that algorithm, that idea. Now, is an idea an *invention*?
Historically, no: the U.S. Patent Office gives “abstract ideas” as an
example of what does not qualify for a patent[^2]. Then the natural question
is, does an *implementation* of an idea count as an invention?

Now the waters become murky. The Supreme Court has struggled with this
difference before—and in *In re Bilski*, ruled that yes, an abstract
algorithm implemented on a physical computer qualifies for a patent, if “(1)
it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a
particular article into a different state or thing”, leaving what qualified
as a “transformation” undefined[^3], never mind the habit of lawyers to
twist wording to suit their purposes.

In any case, the end result is that software patents exist. How do they
affect you and me?

- Apple has patented
  [slide-to-unlock](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=8,046,721.PN.&OS=PN/8,046,721&RS=PN/8,046,721),
  the idea of
  [searching multiple data sources at once](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN/8086604),
  and built-in spell check, and then
  [sued Samsung](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-sues-samsumg-for-slide-to-unlock-2012-2). (The
  article is rather one-sided, however.) And there’s even
  [some prior art](http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/699/prior-art-for-apples-unified-search-patent)
  for the search patent!
- On the other side of the smartphone wars, Google patented
  [the notification shade/center](http://www.google.com/patents/US20090249247). No
  lawsuit yet, however—but imagine if Apple had to remove its notification
  center from your iPhone. (No worries, though, [Apple applied for its own patent](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2012170446A3)!)
