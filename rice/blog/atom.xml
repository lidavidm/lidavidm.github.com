                                &lt;p&gt;“It’s good for you,” said my mother as she saw me grimace when she placed
another piece of ginger in my mouth. Sitting in the backseat of the car,
clutching the door handle, I felt my head spin. The feeling was all too
familiar. Only after five hours did the travel sickness subside after we
arrived in the district of Nasik, India.
My mother often traveled to various districts for work and whenever
possible, brought me along with her. In this visit, she was to oversee
various social welfare schemes in the region, one of which included the
introduction of smokeless chulhe (rustic stoves) in rural households. A
short film on new interventions illustrated that by eliminating smoke, the
new stoves would reduce the immediate risk of respiratory ailments and the
long term effects of air pollution. Although I was impressed by the idea, my
mother learned that the women, the supposed beneficiaries, did not share the
same sentiment, preferring their former stoves. This was because the heat
which escaped from the earlier stoves helped dry the washing which they hung
indoors and the smoke released kept insects and mosquitoes at bay. At the
time, their reasoning made sense to me as well. Why bring change when it
isn’t&amp;nbsp;wanted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little insight into the needs and the culture of a
community, people can surely be engaged in the development&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, I &lt;strong&gt;took to studying the rural Indian economy in greater
depth. I read&lt;/strong&gt; a success story in which similar ergonomic stoves were made
by the beneficiaries themselves with local materials. As active participants
in the program, they accepted the change quite easily. Thinking back to the
women in Nasik, I understood that the smokeless chulhe were certainly “for
their own good”. However, just as the pungent taste of ginger repelled me
from the remedy, losing the perceived advantages of the primitive stoves
discouraged the villagers from adopting change. Considerable rigor had gone
into developing and supplying the improved stoves. However, this technical
innovation could bring change only when people participated in it and
accepted it. With a little insight into the needs and the culture of a
community, people can surely be engaged in the development process. It was
when I understood the benefits of ginger and acquired a taste for it that I
began to enjoy the&amp;nbsp;ride.&lt;/p&gt;
