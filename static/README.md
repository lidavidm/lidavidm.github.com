# SymPy Web Static Files

Usage:

- Add as a submodule under the `static` directory:

      git submodule add git@github.com:lidavidm/sympy-web-static.git static

- Work on the website as usual; make changes under the `static`
  directory. Remember to commit those changes and push those separately to
  this repository and test against all websites using this code.
